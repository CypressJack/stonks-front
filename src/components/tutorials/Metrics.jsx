      <h3>What Are Metrics?</h3>
      <p>
        Metrics are measures of quantitative assessment commonly used for
        assessing, comparing, and tracking performance or production. Generally,
        a group of metrics will typically be used to build a dashboard that
        management or analysts review on a regular basis to maintain performance
        assessments, opinions, and business strategies.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        Metrics have been used in accounting, operations, and performance
        analysis throughout history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Metrics come in a wide range of varieties with industry standards and
        proprietary models often governing their use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Executives use them to analyze corporate finance and operational
        strategies. Analysts use them to form opinions and investment
        recommendations. Portfolio managers use metrics to guide their investing
        portfolios. Furthermore, project managers also find them essential in
        leading and managing strategic projects of all kinds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, metrics refer to a wide variety of data points generated from a
        multitude of methods. Best practices across industries have created a
        common set of comprehensive metrics used in ongoing evaluations.
        However, individual cases and scenarios typically guide the choice of
        metrics used.
      </p>

      <h3>Choosing Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        Every business executive, analyst, portfolio manager, and the project
        manager has a range of data sources available to them for building and
        structuring their own metric analysis. This can potentially make it
        difficult to choose the best metrics needed for important assessments
        and evaluations. Generally, managers seek to build a dashboard of what
        has come to be known as key performance indicators (KPIs).
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to establish a useful metric, a manager must first assess its
        goals. From there, it is important to find the best outputs that measure
        the activities related to these goals. A final step is also setting
        goals and targets for KPI metrics that are integrated with business
        decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Academics and corporate researchers have defined many industry metrics
        and methods that can help shape the building of KPIs and other metric
        dashboards. An entire decision analysis method called applied
        information economics was developed by Douglas Hubbard for analyzing
        metrics in a variety of business applications. Other popular decision
        analysis methods include cost-benefit analysis, forecasting, and Monte
        Carlo simulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several businesses have also popularized certain methods that have
        become industry standards in many sectors. DuPont began using metrics to
        better their own business and in the process came up with the popular
        DuPont analysis which closely isolates variables involved in the return
        on equity (ROE) metric. GE has also commissioned a set of metrics known
        as Six Sigma that are commonly used today, with metrics tracked in six
        key areas: critical to quality; defects; process capability; variation;
        stable operations; and, design for Six Sigma.
      </p>

      <h3>Examples of Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        While there are a wide range of metrics, below are some commonly used
        tools:
      </p>

      <i>Economic Metrics</i>

      <ul>
        <li>Gross domestic product (GDP)</li>
        <li>Inflation</li>
        <li>Unemployment rate</li>
        <li>Operational Company Metrics</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        From a comprehensive perspective, executives, industry analysts, and
        individual investors often look at key operational performance measures
        of a company, all from different perspectives. Some top-level
        operational metrics include measures derived from the analysis of a
        companyâ€™s financial statements. Key financial statement metrics include
        sales, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), net income, earnings per
        share, margins, efficiency ratios, liquidity ratios, leverage ratios,
        and rates of return. Each of these metrics provides a different insight
        into the operational efficiency of a company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Executives use these operational metrics to make corporate decisions
        involving costs, labor, financing, and investing. Executives and
        analysts also build complex financial models to identify future growth
        and value prospects, integrating both economic and operational metric
        forecasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several metrics that are key to comparing the financial
        position of companies against their competitors or the market overall.
        Two of these key comparable metrics, which are based on market value,
        include price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio.
      </p>

      <i>Portfolio Management</i>

      <p>
        Portfolio managers use metrics to identify investing allocations in a
        portfolio. All types of metrics are also used for analyzing and
        investing in securities that fit a specific portfolio strategy. For
        example, environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are a set
        of standards for a company's operations that socially conscious
        investors use to screen potential investments.
      </p>

      <i>Project Management Metrics</i>

      <p>
        In project management, metrics are essential in measuring project
        progression, output targets, and overall project success. Some of the
        areas where metric analysis is often needed include resources, cost,
        time, scope, quality, safety, and actions. Project managers have the
        responsibility to choose metrics that provide the best analysis and
        directional insight for a project. Metrics are followed in order to
        measure the overall progression, production, and performance.
